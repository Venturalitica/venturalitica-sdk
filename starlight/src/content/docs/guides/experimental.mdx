---

This page documents CLI commands and features that are currently experimental. Their API may change or be removed in future releases.

:::caution
**Experimental**: These features depend on the Venturalitica SaaS platform, which is not yet publicly available. They are included in the SDK for early adopters and internal testing.
:::

---

## CLI: `login`

Authenticate with the Venturalitica SaaS platform.

```bash
venturalitica login
```

Stores credentials locally for use by `pull` and `push` commands. Authentication is required before using any SaaS-connected features.

---

## CLI: `pull`

Pull OSCAL policies and system configuration from the SaaS platform to your local project.

```bash
venturalitica pull
```

### What It Downloads

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `model_policy.oscal.yaml` | Model fairness and performance policy |
| `data_policy.oscal.yaml` | Data quality and privacy policy |
| `system_description.yaml` | Annex IV.1 system identity fields |

### Behavior

- Authenticates using stored credentials from `login`
- Fetches policies from `/api/pull?format=oscal`
- Writes files to the current working directory
- Reports bound and unbound risks from the SaaS platform

:::note
**Format Difference**: The `pull` command currently downloads policies in `system-security-plan` OSCAL format, while the Dashboard Policy Editor generates `assessment-plan` format. Both formats are supported by the SDK loader, but the difference may cause confusion when editing pulled policies in the Dashboard. This will be unified in a future release.

---

## CLI: `push`

Push local compliance evidence to the Venturalitica SaaS platform.

```bash
venturalitica push
```

Uploads enforcement results and trace files from `.venturalitica/` to the cloud for team visibility and audit trails.

---

## CLI: `ui` (Stable)

Launch the local Glass Box Dashboard. This command is **stable** and fully documented.

```bash
venturalitica ui
```

See [Dashboard Guide](/venturalitica-sdk/guides/dashboard/) for full documentation.

## Feature Status Matrix

| Feature | Status | Depends On |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `venturalitica ui` | Stable | Local only |
| `venturalitica login` | Experimental | SaaS platform |
| `venturalitica pull` | Experimental | SaaS platform |
| `venturalitica push` | Experimental | SaaS platform |
| `vl.enforce()` | Stable | Local only |
| `vl.monitor()` | Stable | Local only |
| `vl.quickstart()` | Stable | Local only |
| `vl.wrap()` | Experimental | Local only |

## SDK ↔ SaaS Data Flow

The experimental CLI commands enable a handshake between your local environment and the SaaS platform:

```text
  Developer Workstation                 Venturalitica SaaS
  ════════════════════                  ═══════════════════

  venturalitica login  ───────────────► Auth (API key)
                        ◄───────────── Token stored locally

  venturalitica pull   ───────────────► GET /api/pull?format=oscal
                        ◄───────────── OSCAL policies + system_description

  vl.enforce(policy=…)  ──► local       (no network call)
  vl.monitor(…)          ──► local       .venturalitica/trace_*.json

  venturalitica push   ───────────────► POST /api/push
                        ◄───────────── Evidence archived in cloud
```

All enforcement and monitoring runs **locally** — the SaaS platform is only used for policy distribution and evidence archival.
