The **Venturalítica Dashboard** is your local AI Assurance workspace. It guides you through 4 phases of the EU AI Act evidence collection lifecycle without leaving your terminal.

:::caution
This tool **assists with evidence gathering** and does not constitute legal advice or guarantee regulatory compliance.
:::

## Launch

```bash
venturalitica ui
```

Or with uv:

```bash
uv run venturalitica ui
```

The dashboard opens at `http://localhost:8501` in your default browser.

---

## Dashboard Architecture

The dashboard follows a **4-phase Assurance Journey** mapped to EU AI Act requirements:

```
Home (AI Assurance — Evidence Collection)
  |
  +-- Phase 1: System Identity     (Annex IV.1)
  |
  +-- Phase 2: Risk Policy         (Articles 9-10)
  |
  +-- Phase 3: Verify & Evaluate   (Articles 11-15)
  |       |
  |       +-- Transparency Feed
  |       +-- Technical Integrity
  |       +-- Policy Enforcement
  |
  +-- Phase 4: Technical Report    (Annex IV)
```

**Phase gating** is enforced: Phase 2 requires Phase 1 evidence, Phase 3 requires Phase 2, and Phase 4 requires Phase 3.

---

## Home: AI Assurance — Evidence Collection

The home screen presents 4 steps as a progress dashboard. Each step shows its evidence status:

| Step | Status Check | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Define System | `system_description.yaml` exists | System identity and hardware description |
| 2. Define Policies | `model_policy.oscal.yaml` exists | OSCAL risk and data governance policies |
| 3. Review Evidence | `results.json` or `trace_*.json` exists | Telemetry, traces, and metric validation |
| 4. Generate Report | `venturalitica_technical_doc.json` exists | Generated Annex IV technical file |

Click any step card to navigate directly to that phase.

## Phase 1: System Identity

**EU AI Act:** Annex IV.1 (General Description of the AI System)

Define the "ground truth" of your AI system using the **System Identity Editor**. This creates `system_description.yaml` with:

- **System name and version**
- **Intended purpose** (e.g., "Credit scoring for loan applications")
- **Provider information**
- **Hardware description** (compute resources used)
- **Interaction description** (how users interact with the system)

The editor provides a structured form. All fields map directly to Annex IV.1 requirements.

---

## Phase 2: Risk Policy

**EU AI Act:** Articles 9 (Risk Management) and 10 (Data Governance)

The **Policy Editor** lets you create and edit OSCAL policy files visually — this is the **Compliance-as-Code** step. It generates `assessment-plan` format OSCAL YAML with:

- **Model Policy** (`model_policy.oscal.yaml`): Fairness and performance controls for model behavior
- **Data Policy** (`data_policy.oscal.yaml`): Data quality and privacy controls for training data

### Policy Editor Features

- Add controls with metric selection from the full registry
- Set thresholds and comparison operators
- Map protected attributes (dimension binding)
- Preview the generated OSCAL YAML
- Save directly to your project directory

:::tip
The Policy Editor generates `assessment-plan` format, which is the canonical OSCAL format used throughout the SDK. See [Policy Authoring Guide](/guides/policy-authoring/) for the manual YAML format.

## Phase 3: Verify & Evaluate

**EU AI Act:** Articles 11-15 (Technical Documentation, Record-Keeping, Transparency, Human Oversight, Accuracy)

This phase requires evidence from running `vl.enforce()` and `vl.monitor()`. Select an evidence session from the sidebar to inspect.

![Phase 3 — Verify & Evaluate](/images/phase3_verify_evaluate.png)

### Session Selector

The sidebar shows all available evidence sessions:

- **Global / History**: Aggregated results from `.venturalitica/results.json`
- **Named sessions**: Individual `vl.monitor("session_name")` runs with their own trace files

### Tab: Transparency Feed

Maps to **Article 13** (Transparency). Shows:

- Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) -- all Python dependencies with versions
- Code context -- AST analysis of the script that generated evidence
- Runtime metadata -- timestamps, duration, success/failure status

### Tab: Technical Integrity

Maps to **Article 15** (Accuracy, Robustness, Cybersecurity). Shows:

- Environment fingerprint (SHA-256 hash)
- Integrity drift detection (did the environment change during execution?)
- Hardware telemetry (peak RAM, CPU count)
- Carbon emissions (if CodeCarbon is installed)

### Tab: Policy Enforcement

Maps to **Article 9** (Risk Management). Shows:

- Per-control assurance results with pass/fail status
- Actual metric values vs. policy thresholds
- Visual breakdown of which controls passed and which failed
- Assurance score summary

---

## Phase 4: Technical Report

**EU AI Act:** Article 11 and Annex IV (Technical Documentation)

The **Annex IV Generator** produces the comprehensive technical documentation required for High-Risk AI systems. It combines:

![Phase 4 — Annex IV Generator](/images/annex_iv_generator.png)

- **Phase 1 data**: System identity from `system_description.yaml`
- **Phase 2 data**: Risk policies from OSCAL files
- **Phase 3 data**: Evidence from enforcement results and traces

### LLM Provider Selection

| Provider | Privacy | Sovereignty | Speed | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Cloud (Mistral API) | Encrypted transport | EU-hosted | Fast | Final polish |
| Local (Ollama) | 100% offline | Generic | Slower | Iterative testing |
| Sovereign (ALIA) | Hardware locked | Spanish native | Slow | Research only |

:::caution
**ALIA Requirements**: ALIA is a 40B parameter model requiring ~41GB RAM/VRAM. It is experimental.
:::

### Generation Process

1. **Scanner**: Reads trace files and evidence
2. **Planner**: Determines which Annex IV sections apply
3. **Writer**: Drafts each section citing specific metric values
4. **Critic**: Reviews the draft against ISO 42001

### Output

The generator produces:

- `venturalitica_technical_doc.json` -- structured data
- `Annex_IV.md` -- human-readable markdown document

Convert to PDF:

```bash
# Simple
pip install mdpdf && mdpdf Annex_IV.md

# Advanced
pandoc Annex_IV.md -o Annex_IV.pdf --toc --pdf-engine=xelatex
```

## Project Context

The dashboard operates on your **current working directory**. It reads:

| File | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `system_description.yaml` | Phase 1 system identity |
| `model_policy.oscal.yaml` | Phase 2 model policy |
| `data_policy.oscal.yaml` | Phase 2 data policy |
| `.venturalitica/results.json` | Phase 3 enforcement results |
| `.venturalitica/trace_*.json` | Phase 3 execution traces |
| `.venturalitica/bom.json` | Phase 3 software bill of materials |
| `venturalitica_technical_doc.json` | Phase 4 generated documentation |

Run your `vl.enforce()` and `vl.monitor()` calls from the same directory where you launch `venturalitica ui`.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

The dashboard uses Streamlit. Standard Streamlit shortcuts apply:

- `R` -- Rerun the app
- `C` -- Clear cache
- Settings menu (top-right hamburger) for theme switching
