## The Fundamentals: From Risk to Code

Building High-Risk AI requires a fundamental shift in how we approach testing. It is no longer enough to check for technical accuracy (e.g., F1 Score); we must now mathematically prove that the system respects fundamental rights, such as non-discrimination or data quality, as mandated by the **EU AI Act**.

Venturalitica automates this by treating "Assurance" as a dependency. Instead of vague legal requirements, you define strict policies (OSCAL) that your model must pass before it can be deployed. This turns compliance into a deterministic engineering problem.

:::note
**Is my System High-Risk?**

According to [**Article 6**](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/es/article/6/) of EU AI Act, a system is High-Risk if it is covered by [**Annex I**](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/es/annex/1/) (Safety Components like machinery/medical devices) or listed in [**Annex III**](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/es/annex/3/) (Biometrics, Critical Infrastructure, Education, Employment, Essential Services, Law Enforcement, Migration, Justice/Democracy).
:::

**The Translation Layer:**

1.  **Fundamental Risk**: "The model must not discriminate against protected groups" (Art 9).

2.  **Policy Control**: "Disparate Impact Ratio must be > 0.8".

3.  **Code Assertion**: `assert calculated_metric > 0.8`.

When you run `quickstart()`, you are technically running a **Unit Test for Ethics**.

## Step 2: Run Your First Audit

```python
import venturalitica as vl

vl.quickstart('loan')
```

**Output:**

```text
[Venturalítica] Scenario: Fairness Audit loan_scoring_v2
[Venturalítica] Loaded: UCI Dataset #144 (1000 samples)

  CONTROL                DESCRIPTION                            ACTUAL     LIMIT      RESULT

  credit-data-imbalance  Data Quality                           0.429      > 0.2      PASS
  credit-data-bias       Disparate impact                       0.818      > 0.8      PASS
  credit-age-disparate   Age disparity                          0.286      > 0.5      FAIL
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Audit Summary: VIOLATION | 2/3 controls passed
```

The audit detected age-based bias in the UCI German Credit dataset.

## Step 3: What's Happening Under the Hood

The `quickstart()` function is a wrapper that performs the full compliance lifecycle in one go:

1.  **Downloads Data**: Fetches the UCI German Credit dataset.
2.  **Loads Policy**: Uses a built-in OSCAL policy that defines fairness rules (thresholds, metrics, protected attributes).
3.  **Enforces**: Runs the audit (`vl.enforce`).
4.  **Records**: Captures the evidence (`trace.json`) for the dashboard.

Here's what the equivalent "manual" flow looks like. In the [Full Lifecycle](/venturalitica-sdk/full-lifecycle/) guide you will write your own OSCAL policies and run this yourself:

```python
from ucimlrepo import fetch_ucirepo
import venturalitica as vl

# 1. Load Data (The "Risk Source")
dataset = fetch_ucirepo(id=144)
df = dataset.data.features
df['class'] = dataset.data.targets

# 2. Define the Policy (The "Law")
# quickstart() uses a built-in policy dict.
# In real projects, you write your own OSCAL YAML file.
# See the Full Lifecycle guide for a copy-paste example.

# 3. Run the Audit (The "Test")
# This automatically generates the Evidence Bill of Materials (BOM)
with vl.monitor("manual_audit"):
    vl.enforce(
        data=df,
        target="class",          # The outcome (True/False)
        gender="Attribute9",     # Protected Group A
        age="Attribute13",       # Protected Group B
        policy="data_policy.oscal.yaml"  # Your OSCAL policy file
    )
```

:::note
The code above requires a `data_policy.oscal.yaml` file. Head to the [Full Lifecycle](/venturalitica-sdk/full-lifecycle/) guide (Step 2) for the complete copy-paste YAML, or jump straight to [Level 1: The Engineer](/venturalitica-sdk/academy/level1-policy/) to learn how to write one from scratch.

### The Policy Logic

The OSCAL policy is the bridge between law and code. It tells the SDK *what* to check so you don't have to hardcode it.

```yaml
# ... inside your OSCAL policy YAML ...
- control-id: credit-data-bias
  description: "Disparate impact ratio must be > 0.8 (80% rule)"
  props:
    - name: metric_key
      value: disparate_impact   # <--- The Python Function to call
    - name: threshold
      value: "0.8"              # <--- The Limit to enforce
    - name: operator
      value: ">"                # <--- The Logic (> 0.8)
    - name: "input:dimension"
      value: gender             # <--- Maps to "Attribute9"
```

This design decouples **Assurance** (the policy file) from **Engineering** (the python code).

## Why This Matters

Without this mechanism, your AI model is a legal "Black Box":

*   **Liability**: You cannot prove you checked for bias *before* deployment (Art 9).
*   **Fragility**: Compliance is a manual checklist, easily forgotten or skipped.
*   **Opacity**: Auditors cannot see the link between your code and the law.

By running `quickstart()`, you have just generated an immutable **Compliance Artifact**. Even if the laws change, your evidence remains.

## Step 4: The "Glass Box" Dashboard

Now that we have the evidence (the "Black Box" recording), let's inspect it in the **Regulatory Map**.

```bash
venturalitica ui
```

Navigate through the **Compliance Map** tabs:

*   **Article 9 (Risk)**: See the failed `credit-age-disparate` control. This is your technical evidence of "Risk Monitoring".
*   **Article 10 (Data)**: See the data distribution and quality checks.
*   **Article 13 (Transparency)**: Review the "Transparency Feed" to see your Python dependencies (BOM).

---

## Step 5: Generate Documentation (Annex IV)

The final step is to turn this evidence into a legal document.

1.  In the Dashboard, go to the **"Generation"** tab.
2.  Select **"English"** (or Spanish/Catalan/Euskera).
3.  Click **"Generate Annex IV"**.

Venturalitica will draft a technical document that references your specific run:

> *"As evidenced in `trace_quickstart_loan.json`, the system was audited against **[OSCAL Policy: Credit Scoring Fairness]**. A deviation was detected in Age Disparity (0.36), identifying a potential risk of bias..."*

### References
